                    Three Reasons We Love St. Petersburg
                    <br>
                    Everyone is talking about St. Petersburg. It’s one of Florida’s most desirable and livable cities,
                    with its modern upscale feel and gorgeous outdoor landscapes. We think St. Petersburg is quite
                    possibly the most perfect neighborhood in the state of Florida, and we’re not alone. Here are three
                    reasons that we love St. Petersburg, and know you will too!
                    <br>
                <ol type="1" start="1">
                    <li>Pier</li>
                    The iconic pier recently reopened six months ago after a seven-year redesign, and now boasts
                    gorgeous architecture and 360 degree views of the beach, places to play and learn, and five unique
                    restaurants.

                    St. Pete’s Pier was recently named runner-up for USA Today’s Best New Attraction of 2020,
                    highlighting the diversity of offerings for all ages and interests.
                    <li>The Weather and Outdoor Living</li>
                    Nicknamed “The Sunshine City,” St. Petersburg residents can expect 361 sunny days a year! But don’t
                    worry, sunshine doesn’t always mean hot. This week the temp topped out at a perfect 70 degrees!
                    <br>
                    All those sunny days make St. Petersburg the perfect city for outdoor living. Obviously, hitting the
                    beach is a favorite pastime year-round with St. Pete Beach being recognized as one of the best
                    beaches in the country and nearby Fort De Soto Beach being named the number one beach for families
                    in the entire USA!
                    But if you prefer other outdoor activities, there are endless options! With the largest network of
                    cycling and pedestrian trails in the entire Southeast, more than 225 city parks, and 9 nature
                    preserves and wilderness areas, there is literally something for everyone.
                    <li>The Culture</li>
                    St. Petersburg is a unique combination of the old and the new. Its culture pulls from long beloved
                    historic locations and cultural attractions standing aside modern architecture, award-winning
                    restaurants and over 50 museums, gardens and art galleries.
                    <br>
                    In the heart of it all, Domus Urbana delivers the complete Downtown St. Petersburg living experience
                    with all your favorite things to do right outside your door

                    beaches.

                    In this article, we’ll take a closer look at 25 fascinating facts about Miami. From its history and
                    iconic architecture, we’ll delve into what makes this city so unique and captivating.
                    <br>Miami, the largest city in South Florida, is a destination that offers a unique blend of

                    Miami was once known as ‘Biscayne Bay Country’ and its name comes from the Native American word for
                    ‘sweet water’. Miami has more than 800 parks and is home to one of the largest collections of Art
                    Deco architecture in the world.

                    But perhaps what makes Miami so appealing is its reputation as a place where anything goes – where
                    people can let loose and embrace their wild side. So whether you’re looking to soak up some sun on
                    South Beach or explore the colorful neighborhoods of Little Havana, Miami is sure to leave a lasting

                <p>Dining out, like everything else, is getting more expensive. In fact, according to the personal
                    finance website WalletHub, restaurant prices rose 6.5 percent between August 2022 and August 2023.
                    But that doesn’t mean you can’t still go out and enjoy yourself every once in a while — especially
                    if you happen to live in one of the top foodie cities in the country.

                    WalletHub just released its 2023 report of the Best Foodie Cities in America, which broke down the
                    best, and the most affordable, local food scenes in the U.S.

                    To determine the rankings, the team compared more than 180 of the nation’s largest cities, analyzing
                    each across 28 metrics, including the affordability and accessibility of excellent restaurants,
                    number of food festivals per capita, craft breweries and wineries per capita, restaurant diversity,
                    Michelin stars, and more.

                    17 Free Things to Do in Orlando
                    After weighing the data, the researchers named Orlando, Florida, the No. 1 food city in America. It
                    won because of the diversity and quality of the restaurants — and for another very important reason:
                    “Orlando has the most ice cream and frozen yogurt shops,” WalletHub noted in the report. Orlando
                    also had some of the most coffee shops per capita and the most specialty-food grocery stores — and
                    scored high in the affordability rankings.

                    Other top food cities in WalletHub's rankings included Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California;
                    Miami; San Francisco; Tampa, Florida; San Diego; Las Vegas; Austin, Texas; and Seattle.

                    WalletHub’s rankings also spotlighted a few standout cities that didn't make the top 10. St. Louis,
                    the survey noted, has the most gourmet specialty-food stores of any city, and Miami had the most
                    restaurants of any city surveyed.
