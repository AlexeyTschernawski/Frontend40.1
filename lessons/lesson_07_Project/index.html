                    <strong>Vincent van Gohg</strong>
                    (born March 30, 1853, Zundert, Netherlands—died July 29, 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, France)
                    was a Dutch painter, generally considered the greatest after Rembrandt van Rijn, and one of the
                    greatest of the Post-Impressionists. The striking colour, emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms of
                    his work powerfully influenced the current of Expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh’s art became
                    astoundingly popular after his death, especially in the late 20th century, when his work sold for
                    record-breaking sums at auctions around the world and was featured in blockbuster touring
                    exhibitions. In part because of his extensive published letters, van Gogh has also been mythologized
                    in the popular imagination as the quintessential tortured artist."
